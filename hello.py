"""
Python has 5 data types:
1. None type - an object that does not contain any value
2. Numeric type - int, float, complex
3. Sequences - str, bytes, bytearray, list, tuple, range
4. Sets
5. Mappings

Python has 3 collections (data structures):
1. List - can store any number of objects and values dynamically, and maintains the order
2. Set - cannot store duplicates
3. Dictionary - a map (store a Key,Value pair)
